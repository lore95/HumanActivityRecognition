# OPTIONAL
# In this file you can include help functions and/or classes that you want to use in your notebook
# It makes the code more organized and re-usable to have them on a separate .py file
# Each function and/or class should be separately documented with comments following this pattern:
# - Use: what does it do/serve
# - Inputs: input shape and description
# - Outputs: output shape and description
